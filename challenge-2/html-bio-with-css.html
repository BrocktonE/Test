                              My name is Brockton Edwards.  I am originally from North Carolina and grew up on a small farm outside of Winston-Salem.  
                             I graduated in 2007 from UNC-W with a degree in Geology.  After graduating I moved to Tulsa, Ok to pursue my MS in Geoscience.
                             I spent over 12 years in Oklahoma working exclusively in Upstream Oil and Gas.  After much though and consideration I moved my
                              family back to Wilmington, NC.  My kids love the beach, and I enjoy Inshore fishing. I am currently training to become 
                                 a Java Developer.

                                 </p>
